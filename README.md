# hello-world
Greetings!

I have little to no experience in coding but I'm hoping to get started by utilizing the tools offered by GitHub, Free Code Camp, and Codecademy. Once I feel more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I plan to attend one of Denver's fine code schools or boot camps. From there, conquer the world, I guess.
